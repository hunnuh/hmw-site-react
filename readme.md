I built this site with React to deliver a superior responsive, interactive, and beautiful web space.

As time goes on, I'll be adding to my site, and refactoring things to integrate better practices and organization.

If you want to talk about working together, there's nothing I like talking about more. Don't hesitate to send me an email!

## About Hunter's Poker:

Hunter's Poker is a React-based draw poker game. I made Hunter's Poker as a means to convince YOU (yes, you) that I have the webdev chops to produce a polished and engaging interactive interface.

Hunter's Poker implements the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm to generate a new virtual deck for each hand. Each player is dealt five cards and then they are given a chance to hold up to all five. Players are dealt remaining cards and then the hands are scored, compared, and a winner is delcared. Your opponent's AI is basic, but employs a winning long-term strategy. He always go for the flush!

If you can play 20 hands of this game and have a win percentage over 50%, maybe you should try that luck in Las Vegas!

## About My Portfolio:

I made an image browser from scratch to display my large portfolio. In addition to the actual contents of this portfolio, I wanted to show off my flourishing React abilities by creating an interactive browser.
